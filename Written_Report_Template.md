# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project:
## Analysis outcomes based on launch dates and analysis outcomes based on goals.
---
### Purpose:
### To determine how different campaigns performed in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.
---
## Analysis and Challenges:
# Created two pivot tables from the Kickstarter worksheet data.
---
## The first pivot table was created to determine the launch dates for each month of the year. The monthly outcomes were correlated to the successful, failed and canceled theater campaigns.

## The second pivot table was created to determine the percentage of successful, failed and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date:
### The spring and summer months held the most successful theater campaigns, likely because these are the warmer months of the year and generally people go out more than in the winter months. On the other hand, January had the highest number of canceled theather campaigns. It's interesting to note that the higher the successful theater campaigns, the higher the failed theater campaigns as well,and this correlation is consistent throughout the data.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals:

---
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered:
###Working with a MacBook Pro has been challenging because the usual shortcuts of a PC are not true for a MAC. As such, you have to google a lot of the shortcuts and learn how to properly use your Mac as you go, which can be frustrating at times. Learning how to properly link images and codes to this Readme folder was also challenging as well as how to properly add the assignment to the kickstarter-analysis GitHub repository. GitHub in general has been challenging because it is a new area of learning, as I have never worked with it in the past.  I was able to work through these challenges by looking up the instructions in the course material, by googling and Youtube methods and also by utilizing the Tutor services and asking my tutor for additional assistance.

## Results:

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- The most successful month was May, followed by June, then July, then August and finally February and April were a tie.  
- October did not have any canceled theater campaigns.    
---
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- The lower the goal amount range is, the higher the percentage of successful plays.
---
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
- This dataset limits you to only the theater and play campaigns parent category and subcategory. It does not allow you to analyse the other parent categories and subcategories included in the worksheet data. You are also unable to see the larger international picture of all of the categories included, because it limits you to only the data for the U.S. The worksheet data includes data from other countries as well. 
---
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- Stacked lines with markers
- Stacked columns
- Pie charts

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals:
### There were zero canceled projects.  There is also a direct correlation between the goal amount range of the projects and their successful and failed results. The lower the goal amount range, the higher the percentage and number of successful projects. In retrospect, the higher the goal amount range, the lower the percentage and number of successful projects.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered:
###Working with a MacBook Pro (since I purchased it not too long ago), has been challenging. I'm still not fully familiar with all of the usual shortcuts. I'm aware of the shortcuts for a PC, but not those of a MAC. As such, I have had to google a lot of the shortcuts and learn how to properly use my Mac as I go, which can be frustrating at times. 
###Learning how to properly link images and codes to this Readme folder was also challenging as well as how to properly add the assignment to the kickstarter-analysis GitHub repository. 
###GitHub in general has been challenging because it is a new area of learning, as I have never worked with it in the past.  I was able to work through all of these challenges by looking up the instructions in the course material, by googling and Youtubing methods and also by utilizing the Tutor services and asking my tutor for additional assistance.
